A Concrete5 (v 5.7) block for showing a Twitter feed (or list). 

The UI depends on AngularJS, but there's nothing fancy in here, so should be straight forward to change it to KnockoutJS or something. Or just plain JS, for that matter. Take my code and run with it :-)

I'm using <a href="https://twitteroauth.com">TwitterOAuth</a> to authenticate.
